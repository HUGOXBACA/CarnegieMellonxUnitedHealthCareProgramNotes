MachineLearning with R - tidymodels

parsnip simplifies model parameters and
interfaces
recipes enables feature engineering and
preprocessing
workflows allow you to store and execute
steps together
tune optimizes hyperparameters

#1. Pick a model: in this case, all we need is linear regression, but we could be using e.g. random forests
#2. Set the engine: which package should we look to for this method?
#3. Set the mode (if needed): are we performing classification or regression?
