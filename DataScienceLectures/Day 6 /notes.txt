Density Estimation: intuition & motivation

What is Density? 
  physics: mass of objects can be measured - this is important
    which has more mass - hydrogen of a classroom or golf ball filled with osmium 
      what changed - enviornment by volume, gold ball size or classroom size 
      Density = mass/volume 
      Continous variables has varibale density 
      Probabilites, must follow two things: events must f(0,1), non negative & all probabilites in an event must add up to 1. 
      why 1, becuase we set a fixed volume
       Gausian density, ie bell curve, can lead to normal distrobution 
       68-95-99.7 rule 
       standard deviation - grouping of percentile 
       Normal distrobution(mean, deviation)
      
What is estimation? 
   whats the probability of tempature > 10 degrees? 
   why not use limted sample? becuase it's not a complete picture, we need to build the picture
   infrence -> 
   nature generates the tempature according to some probability density , so we need to genearte more assumptions. 
   nature , N(M,D), M is assumed. density has some perams. 
   stats is indeed ubjetive

back to histogram 
Humble hisogram, continuouos graph, 0 - n, divide and conqure, then gives you bins with distance and shots per distance

small bandwidth, very spikey. large bandwidth, 

kernel Density 

we need chouse a kernael function, continious weighting function, 
  take a value, at weight 0 - highest , symettic function, further away less weight, so it says, is to locally approximate each point ie drop the same kernel at evey data point, 
  resutling in a curve with each data point whos sum is one but the graph , viz, will have a greatest peak where the data is most clustered ie density.

  Sloped are greatest where more pluses, histograms are square beucase we're adding up the squares of the graph. 
  
  if we pick a smooth kernel, we get one big
