Density Estimation: intuition & motivation

What is Density? 
  physics: mass of objects can be measured - this is important
    which has more mass - hydrogen of a classroom or golf ball filled with osmium 
      what changed - enviornment by volume, gold ball size or classroom size 
      Density = mass/volume 
      Continous variables has varibale density 
      Probabilites, must follow two things: events must f(0,1), non negative & all probabilites in an event must add up to 1. 
      why 1, becuase we set a fixed volume
       Gausian density, ie bell curve, can lead to normal distrobution 
       68-95-99.7 rule 
       standard deviation - grouping of percentile 
       Normal distrobution(mean, deviation)
      
What is estimation? 
   whats the probability of tempature > 10 degrees? 
   why not use limted sample? becuase it's not a complete picture, we need to build the picture
   infrence -> 
   nature generates the tempature according to some probability density , so we need to genearte more assumptions. 
   nature , N(M,D), M is assumed. density has some perams. 
   stats is indeed ubjetive
