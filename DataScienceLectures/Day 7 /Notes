Clustering - K-means

Unsupervised Learning

unsupervised learning is suitable for problems that require the algorithms to identify and extract similarities between the inputs so that similar inputs can be categorised together. In contrast to supervised learning, unsupervised learning methods are suitable when the output variables (i.e the labels) are not provided.

Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the dataset of interest contains the explanatory variables (also known as the input or features) as well as the target responses (also known as the output labels). Such algorithms attempt to learn a function that approximates the relationship between the feature values and the labels in a way that it’d be able to generalise well to new unseen data.

What isclustering(akaclusteranalysis)?

observations within clusters are more similar to each other,
observations in different clusters are more different from each other
How do we define distance / dissimilarity between observations?
Euclidean distance between observations i and j 

d(xi, xj) =Sqrt((Xi1 - Xj1)^2 + (Xip - Xjp)^2 )
Euclidean space is the length of a line segment between the two points.
The Euclidean is often the “default” distance used in e.g., K-nearest neighbors (classification) or K-means (clustering) to find the “k closest points” of a particular sample point.

density is unsupervised

  what are . files and what is their purpose? 
  legacy term for system archetecture & config files 
  copy - cp [what to where] + options
  mv - move [what to where ] + options
  rename mv [file] to [where + newname.withtype] 
  mkdir - make dir [ options ] [namedir/namedir/..]
  lines of a file 
  wc [ options ] [ filename.type ]
  head / tail is header and footer of a file 
  history command shows you 10 prev commands
  less, more to inspect a file
  find , very sophisticated 
  find Dekstop -maxdepth 2 -size +500k -size -10M
  'find root_path -maxdepath 2 -size +500k -size -10m is between 500k to 10M'
    find a file within the path 2 levels deep who's size 
  
  alias ll='ls -1'
    instead of ls -ll , just customize to use ll
     where to save this? 
      we need to save, persistance, these configurable, .bashrc
      ~/.bashrc
      touch ~/.bashrc
      here you need to save it in the home dir, 
   alias ll="ls -l"
   save in ~/.bashrc
   typically, 3 chars of less
